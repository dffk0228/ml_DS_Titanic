# ML_DS_Titanic
The Titanic dataset is commonly used to create predictive models for identifying which passengers survived the disaster. It contains various passenger details, including age, gender, class, fare, and other attributes, enabling an exploration of different factors that may have impacted survival. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict survival outcomes. I have chosen the Random Forest model and will compare its performance with the Decision Tree model to determine which one more accurately predicts the safety of Titanic passengers.
The chosen machine learning model, Random Forest, will be evaluated against the Decision Tree model. The comparison will determine which model is more accurate in predicting the safety of Titanic passengers.
